Can you spot all of the mistakes📜💯❓ These code has a few errors in them like syntax errors (most common)🤭🤔🤯

e.g.
deesplay.shw:(HAPPY)
➡
display.show(Image.HAPPY)

➡⫷5⫸
Are there any mistakes in here?😕🤨They all are existing pins and there are no syntax errors (Not lying!)

from microbit import *

while True:
    pin22.write_digital(1)
    sleep(21)
    pin22.write_digital(0)
    sleep(100)
    pin21.write_digital(1)
    sleep(240)
    pin21.write_digital(0)
    pin17.write_digital(1)
    sleep(549)
    pin17.write_digital(0)
