Can you spot all of the mistakes📜💯❓ These code has a few errors in them like syntax errors (most common)🤭🤔🤯

e.g.
deesplay.shw:(HAPPY)
➡
display.show(Image.HAPPY)

➡⫷3⫸
Warning: Need advanced knowledge on pins
✨✴✳***This code is used to let all of the LED lights be on while using pins 3-4, 6-7 and 9-10 to connect to external devices. Will it work?***✳✴✨


from microbit import *

while True:
  display.show(image)
  image = Image("99999:"
                "99999:"
                "99999:"
                "99999:"
                "99999")
